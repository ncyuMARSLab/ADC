## Introduction ##
This repository implements Asymmetric Distance Computation and computes the recall.  
It works on Windows with Visual Studio C++ project.  

## Input Data ##
It provides 2 different approach to implement ADC, "16tables" and "8+8tables".  

They are different from the input data.  

For "16tables":  Query, codebook and clusterMember of the data, ground truth and candidate.  
For "8+8tables":  Query, codebook and clusterMember of both the data and the residual, ground truth and candidate.  
Expect ground truth and candidate, "Query, codebook and clusterMember" are divided into 16 tables for "16" or 8 tables for "8+8".  

Codebook records the centroid of clusters.  
ClusterMember records the members that data belongs to the cluster.  
The residual is the difference between data and its centroid.  

If the codebook of data is generated by "optimal product quantization", the "query" need to multiply by the "rotate matrix".  

## Usage ##
Building the project with Visual Studio on Windows.
