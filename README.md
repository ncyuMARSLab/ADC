This repository implements Asymmetric Distance Computation and computes the recall.  

It provides 2 different approach to implement, "16" and "8+8".  
They are different from the input data.  
For "16":  Query, OPQ codebook and clusters of the dataset, ground truth and candidate  
For "8+8":  Query, OPQ codebook and clusters of both the dataset and the residual, ground truth and candidate  
Expect ground truth and candidate, "Query, codebook and clusters" are divided into 16 tables for "16" or 8 tables for "8+8".
